# Operation-Level-Synthesis

Main takeaways on Bambu

    • Bambu tend to generate VHDL files of much larger size than Vivado, this is probably due to the use of constraints in Vivado and in Bambu we didn’t use any, therefore, using constraints [directives] in Bambu may result in more optimized designs
    • the ‘*’ and ‘&’ signs are used in Bambu to refer to a signal as an output, alongside adding the command “infer” in the command line of Bambu
    • It is usually better to work on editing the C++ operations file generated by DeSCAM before using it as an input to Bambu to make it result in a more optimized code [such as removing ap_int data types for example]
    • Bambu does not deal well with structs and enum data types as outputs
    • Proving the design of Bambu without using a Wrapper is easier, interfacing the operations file with the wrapper is where problems start to happen
